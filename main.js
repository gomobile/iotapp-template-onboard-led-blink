/*
A simple node.js application intended to blink the onboard LED on the Intel based development boards such as the Intel(R) Galileo and Edison with Arduino breakout board.

MRAA - Low Level Skeleton Library for Communication on GNU/Linux platforms
Library in C/C++ to interface with Galileo & other Intel platforms, in a structured and sane API with port nanmes/numbering that match boards & with bindings to javascript & python.

The intent is to make it easier for developers and sensor manufacturers to map their sensors & actuators on top of supported hardware and to allow control of low level communication protocol by high level languages & constructs.
